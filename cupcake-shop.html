    <h2>A little about the chef...</h2>
    <p>Ever since she was a child, Sophia had a love for sweets.  Her mother
    was a baker and owned her very own cake shop.  Growing up, Sophia often
    helped out at her mother's bakery, basking in delight as she helped customers
    choose the right dessert for them.  Often practicing how to bake different sweets,
    Sophia discovered cupcakes to be her dessert medium of choice.  Testing out
    different cupcake recipes at her mother's bakery, she found her cupcakes to
    be a hit!  Thus, Sophia's Cupakes were born.</p>
